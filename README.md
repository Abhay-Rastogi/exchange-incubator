# StackStorm Exchange Incubator

### What is this?

This repository is a very special place where user-submitted packs get reviewed, perfected, approved, and finally transferred to the Exchange.

If you want to submit your pack, it's simple! **Fork this repo, create a subdirectory with your pack, and open a Pull Request.** We'll take it from here. Pro-tip: if you've been working on your pack for quite a while already, and want your git history and versioning preserved, add your pack repo as a submodule.

Even if your pack is work-in-progress, you can still submit it to get advice and early feedback from our engineers! Or ping us [on Slack](https://stackstorm.com/community-signup), which is generally the best place to get advice from the StackStorm Community.

Before you submit a pack, make sure to read the [Create and Contribute a Pack](https://docs.stackstorm.com/reference/packs.html) section of our documentation.
